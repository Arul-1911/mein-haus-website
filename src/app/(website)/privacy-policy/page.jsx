          also collect information about how you browse through our website,

          purposes to ensure that our pages load correctly in your browser, as
          well as to personalize our offers to you. We also use this information

          (d) we track whether certain types of promotional e-mails were opened

          services you might be interested in.
        </p>
        <p dir="ltr" className="my-3">
          In addition, if you create an account, we will use your purchase
          history with us and our affiliates to show you inventory based on your
          purchasing characteristics. This means that you may not see offers and
          inventory that other visitors to our site will see. If you would
          prefer not to have this level of customization, you may use our guest

            6. Your Ad Choices: Interest-Based Advertising.
          </div>
          Our website uses small pixel files (small images) and cookies (small
          text files) to keep track of your browser so that you will be
          recognized when you visit other websites where our third-party ad
          management providers may show you advertisements from us based on your
          visit to our website. Some of these advertisements may be customized
          to particular products and services that you viewed or they may be
          based on inferences about products and services that you might be
          interested in. This is called "interest-based advertising".

        <p dir="ltr" className="my-3">
          These pixel files and cookies are generally valid for a limited number
          of days (usually no more than 90 days) and are provided by our ad
          management providers. We require our ad management providers to
          participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada's Ad Choices
          Program. Visit the Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada: Your
          AdChoices website (http://www.youradchoices.ca) where you can find out
          more information about digital advertising and how you can opt-out of
          interest-based advertising. You can also opt-out of interest-based
          advertising using the link provided in any of our interest-based
          advertisements. Look for the Ad Choices icon or other link provided.

          Please note that if you opt-out of interest-based advertising you may
          still see advertisements from us on other websites. However, they will
          not be customized based on your browsing history on our website. In
          addition, we will continue to customize our offers of products and
          services to you when you are on our website unless you block cookies
          from our website. If you block cookies on our website, certain
          functions, will not function properly because our website must
          recognize you as you move through the checkout process.

            13. How Do We Protect Your Personal Information?
          </div>
          We take administrative, technical and physical measures to safeguard
          your personal information against unauthorized access, unauthorized
          disclosure, theft and misuse. This includes limiting access of
          employees to, and the use of, your personal information through the
          use of passwords and graduated levels of clearance. We do not publish
          all of our security measures online because this may reduce their
          effectiveness. We take physical precautions to ensure that the
          computer servers on which your personal information is stored and
          archived are secure and that access to such servers is protected. We
          educate our employees with respect to their obligations to protect
          your personal information and we require our affiliates and any
          third-party service providers to take comparable steps to ensure the
          protection of any of your personal information that is shared with
          them.

        <p dir="ltr" className="my-3">
          Although we take precautions against possible breaches of our security
          systems, no company can fully eliminate the risks of unauthorized
          access to your personal information and no website is completely
          secure. We cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data
          loss or breaches of our security systems will never occur.
          Accordingly, you should not transmit personal information to us using
          our website if you consider that information to be sensitive.
